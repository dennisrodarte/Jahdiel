The exothermic decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide, catalyzed by Pottasium Iodide (KI).
Best known as Elephants Toothpaste

### Chemical Reaction

Hydrogen Peroxide is decomposes catalytically in the presence of KI followin:
  H2O2(aq) + I-(aq) -> OI-(aq) + H2O(l)
  H2O2(aq) + OI-(aq) -> H2O(l) + O2(g) + I-(aq)
